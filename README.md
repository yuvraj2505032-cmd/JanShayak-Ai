### Accounts and saved data

Use **On this device** to create a local account without configuring Supabase. The password is stored as a salted PBKDF2 hash, and account data stays in that browser on that device. Local accounts do not sync across devices and cannot be recovered if browser data is cleared. Choose **Cloud sync** instead to use a configured Supabase project.
